# UK Used Car Prices

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in exploring the UK Used Car Dataset:  
https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes  
I wanted to better understand:
1. What are the most available vehicles for sale in different price ranges?
2. Which make of vehicles exhibit the most and least depreciation?
3. How do the variables available in this dataset impact the price of the vehicle?

## File Description
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook contains a section of exploratory analysis in searching through the data pertaining to the questions above. There model development section is also contained in the notebook.

## Results
Medium article currently under development to summarize the results. Coming soon.
