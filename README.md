# UK Used Car Prices

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the notebook beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The requirement files for the api and web app are in their respective directories.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in exploring the UK Used Car Dataset:  
https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes  
I wanted to better understand:
1. What are the most available vehicles for sale in different price ranges?
2. Which make of vehicles exhibit the most and least depreciation?
3. How do the variables available in this dataset impact the price of the vehicle?

After answering these questions, a model is developed and deployed.

## File Description
UKUsedCarPricePrediction.ipynb - notebook containing the data exploration and model develop process  
api - flask app: backend API serving the model  
web app - flask app: front end calling the API
